This document presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Absenteeism dataset. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the underlying patterns and trends related to absenteeism in the workplace.
The dataset used in this analysis contains various factors that could potentially influence absenteeism, such as reasons for absence, day of the week, seasons, transportation expense, distance from Residence to Work, etc. Through this EDA, we aim to uncover the relationships between these variables and absenteeism, identify any interesting patterns, and generate insights that could potentially help organizations develop strategies to reduce absenteeism and improve overall productivity.
